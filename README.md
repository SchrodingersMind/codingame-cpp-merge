## Codingame cpp merge

Merge multiple cpp files in one. 
It's pretty handy to write complex code in multiple files, but CodinGame's IDE support submission only in single file 

## Usage

`python3 main.py -i <input_file> -o <out_file>` \
Note: input_file should be located at the root of directory with cpp source code
